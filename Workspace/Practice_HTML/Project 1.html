<h1>About Me</h1>
</body>
<p> Hello, my name is Tanner Day. I was born and raised in Omaha Nebraksa often referred to as the heartland of America. My family is all over the place. My father's family is from England, but now all live in LA California. He served in the military which is how he eventually ended up in Nerbaska. My Mother has a similar story, while she was born an american citizen, she was still born in Germany. With her father being active duty military, she got to grow up all over from Germany, to  Texas, to New York, to even being stationed in Langley Virginia where my grandpa did IT work at the Pentagon. Both my mother and father ended up in Nebraska through the military. Growing up in the farm land and country side of Nebraska, i was raised with very strong family values and morales. Involved in all hobbies and activities, from wrestling, to outdoor hobbies such as hunting and fishing, to going downtown on the weekends. Graduating highschool, i attended class at a trade school for electrical technology. I worked in the field for short amount of time as an electrician aprentice before switching to a manufacturing setting. I got a job at a company work with very high tech print presses and ended up succeeding. The scope of what i do involves alot of mechanical aptitude, and an understanding of electrical systems. After almost 2 years of hard work with the company, they offered me a very good oportunity to move to Knoxville TN where they have purchased a new facility are in the process of expanding operations in Tennessee. As a very adaptable and driven young man, i always dreamnt of the outside world and what life must be like in other cities, other states, and other countries. This amongst many other reasons, is why i have taken an interest of software and coding. My journey so far has brought me to Knoxville TN, and i am so excited to see what the future holds for me. </p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>My hobbies consist of mostly outdoor activities such as hiking, walking around downtown areas, and going on runs. I also enjoy sightseeing and exploring new cities. My biggest hobby is fitness, most of my time outside of work is spent at the gym.</p>
<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p>My main longterm goals are to become proficient in coding languages and software programming, and land a job a tech as a software developer. Because i believe this will open the doors to many other oportunities that i am after. Ideally, i want a job in coding, and then i want to spend my free time traveling.</p>
